description: This fascinating travelogue details the visit of author Ellen Clacy to
  the massive gold mines that were erected in Australia in the nineteenth century.
  Twenty-year-old Clacy's visit wasn't a genteel carriage tour -- she camped under
  the stars and walked hundreds of miles with her brother en route to the mining operations
  at Bendigo. An engaging account for fans of vivid travel accounts.
